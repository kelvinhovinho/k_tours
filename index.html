                <p id="mm">Masai Maraa is a large national game reserve in Narok, Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin. Their description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means "spotted" in the local Maasai language, due to the many short bushy trees which dot the landscape.

                    Maasai Mara is one of the most famous and important wildlife conservation and wilderness areas in Africa, world-renowned for its exceptional populations of lion, African leopard, cheetah and African bush elephant. It also hosts the Great Migration, which secured it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, and as one of the ten Wonders of the World.
                    
                    The Greater Mara ecosystem encompasses areas known as the Maasai Mara National Reserve, the Mara Triangle, and several Maasai Conservancies, including Koiyaki, Lemek, Ol Chorro Oirowua, Mara North, Olkinyei, Siana, </p>

                    Located within Kisumu city, Kisumu Impala Sanctuary lies on the shores of Lake Victoria, covering less than 1km2. The facility was gazetted in 1992. In March 2010, the sanctuary was branded as â€˜a lakeshore walk with impalas'. There are a diverse number of flora (of trees, grass & herbs) and fauna both free ranging and captive. Over 115 species of birds have been recorded. Presently, the sanctuary boasts of all the big five game except for the elephant. A number of nature trail circuits are also available for clients.

Annually, the sanctuary conducts the Kisumu Impala Conservation Boat Race event in November to help create awareness of wildlife, especially the endangered sitatunga antelope.
The animal sanctuary houses lions, African leopards, cape buffalos, olive baboons, hyenas, Tanzanian cheetahs, side-striped jackals, rescued grey parrots, guinea fowls, impalas, leopard tortoises and vervet monkeys among others. Many species of snake, monitor lizard, dragon fly, frog, and butterfly are also present.

The sanctuary also provides an important open grazing for hippopotamus population and refuge for the threatened sitatunga antelope in the nearby swamps.
